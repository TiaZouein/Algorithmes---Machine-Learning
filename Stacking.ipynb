    "# Stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Le stacking est une stratégie puissante d'apprentissage en Machine Learning qui combine les prédictions de nombreux modèles de base pour obtenir une prédiction finale avec de meilleures performances. Contrairement au Boosting, qui consiste à combiner plusieurs prédicteurs faibles identiques, le Stacking combine plusieurs modèles hétérogènes, qui ne sont pas nécessairement identiques, et qui doivent également être performants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "L'idée principale est donc d'alimenter les prédictions de nombreux modèles de base dans un modèle de niveau supérieur connu sous le nom de méta-modèle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Les modèles de base sont généralement sélectionnés de manière à garantir qu'ils produisent différents types d'erreurs et qu'ils se complètent mutuellement."
